// Java methods are called functions or modules in other languages
// There must always be a "main" method

// The first line of a method is called a header

public static int calculateSum(int number1, int number2){
    
}

// Within the header there are several different modifiers

// Access Modifier - Public means any code from any class can use this method. Can be Private and Protected

// Non-Access Modifier - Static, Final, Abstract, Synchronized

// Return Type - this indicates the data typeof the value that this method returns (void means there is no return)
// A method can only return one value!

// Name - Every method is required to have a name, and you should name your methods to reflect the task that they are designed to do. By convention, they should begin with a verb, like we see here, “calculate”, and optionally, adjectives or nouns can follow, such as “Sum”.
// One deviation from this convention is for methods that return a boolean data type. By convention, their method names typically ask a question, such as: isSumNegative.
// Remember that by convention, all method names should begin with a lower case.

// Set of Parentheses - can be empty but must exist
