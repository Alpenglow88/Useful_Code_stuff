# Useful_Code_stuff
A repo containing useful snippets of coding in multiple languages

Whenever I learn something new in a language I like to keep track of it so here is where I have documented some useful bits of code that I have come across and things they are used for.

Where possible they are organised and repeated across languages but this is not always possible so hopefully it matches as well as possible!

# Languages

Currently this repo supports the following languages to some degree or another:

* [Ruby](./ruby.rb)
* [Javascript](./javascript.js)

# Test files
There are test files that are included here so that you can try out any piece of code to make sure it does what you expect. In order to run these you simply need to run the commands listed in the table below. You will need to ensure you have the correct things installed to run the files so check the prerequisites before running them,

|Language|Prerequisites|Command|
|----------|-------------|----------|
|Ruby|Ruby|ruby test.rb|
|Javascript|Node|node test.rb|
